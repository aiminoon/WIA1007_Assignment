# WIA1007 Introduction to Data Science Group Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains the group assignment for the course WIA1007 Introduction to Data Science. In this mini project, students work collaboratively to analyze and visualize real-world data using Python. The objective is to apply data science concepts such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization to uncover meaningful insights from the dataset. Details of the dataset, methodology, and findings are documented in the project notebook.

## Objective
The main objectives of this assignment are:
- To enhance students’ analytical skills through practical data handling.
- To stimulate critical thinking and understanding of real-world predictive analytics.
- To apply data science workflows including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and model training.

## Background and Requirement

### Problem Statement
Our team was tasked with building a predictive model for **credit risk assessment** based on a dataset containing information about individuals' financial status and loan applications. The final deliverable is a data science notebook that demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline—from raw data to predictive insight.

### Minimal Requirements
The project must include the following:

- A cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
- Descriptive and visual analysis of data.
- Feature engineering and normalization.
- Machine learning model implementation (CatBoostClassifier).
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

### Additional Features

- Both Min-Max and Z-Score normalization were applied.
- BorderlineSMOTE was used to address class imbalance.
- Grouped aggregations and multiple visualizations were used to derive insights.
- A complete evaluation function to summarize model performance.

## Submission Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook with complete implementation.
- Explanation of each data science step (with inline comments).
- Visualizations and grouped statistics for enhanced interpretability.
- Model evaluation and justification of the chosen approach.
